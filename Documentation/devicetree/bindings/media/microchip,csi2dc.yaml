  CSI2DC - Camera Serial Interface 2 Demux Controller

  CSI2DC is a hardware block that receives incoming data from an IDI interface
  and filters packets based on their data type and virtual channel identifier,
  then converts the byte stream into a cross clock domain to a pixel stream
  to a parallel interface that can be read by a sensor controller.

  CSI2DC provides two pipes, one video pipe and one data pipe. Video pipe
  is connected to a sensor controller and the data pipe is accessible
  as a DMA slave port to a DMA controller.

  CSI2DC supports a single 'port' node as a source pad with Synopsys 32-bit
  IDI interface. The connected endpoint must be a IDI interface compatible
  device (like Synopsys CSI2HOST) , that can provide 32-bit IDI interface
  connection as sink pad.
  It should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint' node.
  This node should always have the 'reg' property as 0, being the first child
  node.
  For media entity and endpoints please refer to the bindings defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  For Synopsys IDI interface please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/snps,dw-csi-plat.txt

  CSI2DC supports one 'port' node as sink pad with parallel interface. This is
  called video pipe.
  The reg property inside this 'port' node must have the 'reg' property as 1,
  being the second child node.
  This node must have one 'endpoint', and this 'endpoint' is related to the
  virtual channel identifier.
  The 'reg' property inside this 'endpoint' represents the CSI2 virtual channel
  identifier.
  This 'endpoint' can then be used as a source pad for another controller
  (next in pipeline).
  Please refer to the bindings defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

  CSI2DC must have two clocks to function correctly. One clock is the
  peripheral clock for the inside functionality of the hardware block.
  This is named 'pclk'. The second clock must be the cross domain clock,
  in which CSI2DC will perform clock crossing. This clock must be fed
  by the next controller in pipeline, which usually is a sensor controller.
  Normally this clock should be given by this sensor controller who
  is also a clock source. This clock is named 'scck', sensor controller clock.

  CSI2DC also supports direct access to the data through AHB, via DMA channel,
  called data pipe.
  Because of this, the sink 'port' child node (second) is not mandatory.
  If the sink 'port' child node is missing, only data pipe is available.
